First of all, I would like to deeply thank Horacio G. Rotstein for having given me the opportunity to carry our my final degree project under his supervision and for his strong commitment to mentoring.

I would also like to express my gratitude to the Interdisciplinary Higher Education Center (CFIS) which allowed me to course simultaneously the Degree in Mathematics and the Degree in Engineering Physics at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC).

Last but not least, I want to thank my family, specially my parents for their unconditional support.
